This repo has all the assignments for my Operating Systems I class. The first assignment reads a CSV file with  movie data and processes the data in the file to create structs to hold data for each movie. It creates a linked list of all these structs, gives user choices to ask questiosn about the movies in the data, and prints out the data about the movies per user choice. The second assignment reads directory entries, finds a file in the current directory based on user specified criteria, reads and processes the data in the chosen file, creates a directory, and creates new files in the newly created directory and writes processed data to these files.
